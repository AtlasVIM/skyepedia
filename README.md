# skyepedia
Skyepedia is an encyclopedia for my TTRPG-based creative writting project, Skye's End.
Eras ago, the sky was created and various floating islands appeared within vast regions of the sky, each region being separated by a mysterious mist called the Fics, that changes everything that goes through it. Over millenia sentient creatures started living within these floating isles, what kind of stories and adventures will they have and will they ever find out what lies beyond the boundaries of the Skye?

## Progress & Updates
This project is front-end only for now as no backend or database is fully required to make it functional. It's ready for production overall but the pages for the individual entries are incomplete and I'm still working on a dedicated page for my players' characters.
