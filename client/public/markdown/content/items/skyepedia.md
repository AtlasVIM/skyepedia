The Skyepedia Collectible Card Game is an educational project started by the Skyepedia Club, a Leviathan University club of lovers of history, geography, biology and many other aspects of our reality, also some real enthusiasts for games! 

# Goals!
Our goal is to motivate students to learn more about our world in a fun way, collecting rare cards feels like discovering a hidden secret of our world! There are many students who also enjoy trading and coming up with rules on how to play with the cards, although it was not our initial intention we fully encourage fans to come up with interesting ways to enjoy Skyepedia! 

## Versions & Updates
Although this is the fourth iteration of Skyepedia we have developed it is currently our first official release! We are very proud of what we came up!
