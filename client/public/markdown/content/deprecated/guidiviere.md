Guidivière's name originates from two old vierian words, "Guide" meaning gold and "Vière" meaning river. The birthplace of Guidivière, Gran Vière, is famous for it's flowing golden river that cuts through its capital city and surrounding settlements. It's known for being quite an expansionist industrialized nation, home of artisans, merchants and adventurers.

# Location
As mentioned previously, Guidivière's birth was on the Gran Vière archipelago, an archipelago situated on southern center of the Grand Cumulus region.
## Exploration Era Expansions
With the invention of flight vehicles, Guidivière expanded its territory westward and eastward, bordering Xene in the east and Águafina in the west. Some islands south of the Leviathan River were also colonized.

# Birth of the nation (9.820 P.E.)
Guidivière was officially born as a nation in 14th [Levianes](../literature/grand-cumulus-calendar), 9.820 E.P., as the Kingdom of Guidivière.

# Expansionism (587 E.E.- 910 E.E.)
Though before the 6th Century, the Kingdom of Guidivière had engaged in expansionism, it mostly expanded to uninhabited isles for resource extraction, some even being abandoned again after its resources became unneeded. Expansion to already inhabited isles was very much forbidden by the 187 Commission, but this prohibition did not last.

It was not until 587 E.E. that king Leónard VI and his war council decided to break the tenets of the 187 Commission, invading islands to the west of Guidivière, launching an age of exploration and invention but also conquest and subjugation of other peoples, officially turning the Kingdom into the Empire of Guidivière.

Most nations were incapable of stopping this expansion and some even benefited with the trade routes established after successful colonization, the only nation who actually went to war with Guidivière for their rule-breaking was El-Sha-El.

# War with El-Sha-El (640 E.E. - 665 E.E.)
After Guidivière encroached on isles surrounding the nation of El-Sha-El, some of the local Emirs decided to launch a war against the Empire. This war was quite unsuccessful on both sides, the shaelian emirs had little power against a now region-wide power like Guidivière, as most of the shaelian fleets at the time were still very focused on exploration and diplomacy rather than air battle and the vierian forces had very little experience navigating the maze deserts of El-Sha-El, it simply became impossible to find where the shaelian forces held their key resources and infrastructure.

# War with Umber (680 E.E.)
After the fall of Umber at the hands of Lazlo Illya the Nihilist King, the Guidivièrian Emperor, Emperor Saint-Auguste began a joint war campaign with Kaczyslaw on the now monstrous inhabitants of Umber, it was justified as a moral and divinely guided war against evil but what followed was arguably one of the biggest failures in vierian history, tens of thousands of lives entered the isle of Umber but never came back. 
Of course, Umber retaliated, sending wretches to nearby islands, sowing chaos and panic to the frontier regions of Guidivière and nearby nations, there were even stories of some of these monstrous beings turning people into one of their own, like a virus.

This war campaign reached its peak very early on, within the first century of the war, though it quickly died down after the umberian ships stopped attacking the surrounding areas. Guidivière and Kaczyslaw stopped sending their military and started infrequently contracting adventurers and mercenaries to gather information and try to understand what had happened in the doomed isle. 
Though most came back empty-handed... or empty-shipped.

The war is still on-going though not very actively, some braver folk still venture into Umber, looking for treasure or for answers but most that go don't come back, or atleast don't come back the same.

# Artisans Revolt (910 E.E.)
Expansion had brought a lot of inequality and the constant warring with colonies and other nations had made the general population quite angry with the vierian royals. Starting in the late 800s a popular movement began within artisan guilds, some preached equality and worker rights others defended the freedom of the guilds to act outside royal rule. 

This culminated in the 910 Artisans Revolt where guild members and armed popular militias executed the emperor and exiled his family to Llangar. After this many reforms began and the Guildocracy was established.

# New Voyage (924 E.E. - 1.300 E.R.)
With a new way of doing things, Guidivière sought to repair old wounds with its colonies. Though most wanted independence, many isles remained in the federation after the New voyage reforms. At the same time, to spread some of their revolutionary spirit and expand its influence, the guilds started gravitating towards exploration in the east. 
In other times, expanding towards the East would've been quite hard due to harsh weather conditions and the strong influence of the Xenian Empire, but as new ships were developed and the isles under the Xenian Empire were starting to rebel, the Guidivière Federation started establishing trade routes and donating weapons to popular movements.

# War with Xene Empire (1.128 E.E. - 1.210 E.E.)
The Xenian Empire, in an attempt to regain control of their colonies, attacks vierian isles near the xenian border and larges xenian fleets start dominating the xenian colonies, regaining the control the empire sought after, though this was short-lived. Other nations like Llangar along with Guidivière also started funding rebels and the Xenian Empire fell further into instability as things in the mainland started escalating towards popular revolt.  
The war ends as the Xenian Empire crumbles and Sai-Xene and To-Xene are formed.

# Cultural Shift (1.250s E.E. - 101 E.R.)
As the war with Xene came to a close, relations between Guidivière and the newly formed Sai-Xene were quickly established. The eastern vierian isles, some of them having been part of Xene many centuries before are now the center for trade and cultural exchange between the two nations.  
This meant that Sai-Xenian thought became increasingly popular within Guidivière, later incorporating many of its principles in vierian politics and government. Guidiviere becomes more individualistic and guild structure starts shifting as many guilds start resembling sai-xenian private enterprise.
