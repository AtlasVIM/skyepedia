# Personal Aspects

## Physical Appearance

A man with an unkempt appearance, untrimmed beard hair, brown hair with a fluffy and curly haircut that reminds you of a llangarian sheep, hiding two white Kijin horns. He wears thick black rim glasses and his skin is tanned, hiding his tired eyes, filled with dark bags under them. It’s rare to see him either without a cigarette in hand or with his doctor’s coat, which he uses to teach, or the university branded clothing, which he uses whenever the university needs him for something. 

Something tells you he probably doesn’t sleep more than 4 hours a day. 

## Personality

Constantly tired.

A good teacher and friend to his students, the kind of teacher you would drink a few beers with.

He is also the go-to for anything, may it be students asking for academic or even emotional help or the university asking to deal with any random issue.
