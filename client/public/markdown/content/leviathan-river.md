The Leviathan River is the largest river in all of Grand Cumulus.

It spans all the way across the region, from the eastern boundary (near the Xenian Isle) to the western boundary (near the Syzlaw archipelago), winding its way through many other isles and archipelagos, serving as one of the most important cultural landmarks in all the region.

# Geography

The river is about 5 km deep and 4 km wide, encapsulating many floating isles and archipelagos like the Águafina archipelago and some parts of Guidivière. It is quite a snake-like river as it often loops around itself or goes back towards its origin. 

# Ecology

Since it is such a large mass of water, it is home to many water-based species such aquatic plants, algae, aquatic mammals, fish and even aquatic sentient beings like fishfolk and merfolk. Of course, other species such as birds, wyverns and many other non-aquatic lifeforms also reside in the landmasses within and around the river, using it as a hunting ground, as a source of water or even to transport themselves. 

Such a rich ecosystem can be quite affected by pollution and overfishing so be mindful of our region’s greatest river!
