# What are Gods?

Since the dawn of recorded history, beings with extraordinary power, each embodying concepts, ideas or other aspects of our reality, lived among sentient beings. These beings theologians and historians have come to name them Concepts.

Concepts, many seen as living gods at the time, shaped our reality and how different civilizations, peoples, cultures and common knowledge developed.

It was not until the [First Saint](../religion/revolution) mortally wounded the Concept that later became [The Ruin](../religon/ruin) that the consequences of the death of a Concept was recorded in writing. Upon death, Concepts manifest as constellations in our sky, immortalizing their guiding principles in the stars in our sky. 

These new Constellations become guiding paths for many beings across the region, many people even embracing multiple constellations for guidance as the needs of the people became more complex, for example a farmer asking for guidance to weather related constellations as well as plant related constellations for good harvest. 

It’s also a common belief that any sentient being may become a Concept and later a Constellation, an example being the [First Saint](../religion/revolution), previously a human being that over time became a Concept and later through their death was able to become their own Constellation. 

# Death of Gods

Not much is known about the process of becoming a Constellation but the consequences of a new one being put forth in our world is quite noticeable. Death brings radical change to all the regions, as Concepts stop being bound to the physical world and are now able to inspire all sentient beings to embark on journeys to embody aspects of their being. Instead of a world ruled by external factors, all sentience becomes able to wield the power of different aspects of our reality. As an example, many Saints are people that became intensely guided by particular Constellations, such as the Pine Saint and The Vast. 

Death is likely to bring about a series of dark ages within the region, though most for different reasons, it is not hard to imagine why the death of something so powerful would change the landscape of a civilization. 

Death doesn’t just bring a cultural change or new horizons for sentient thought, many deaths change our physical reality, it’s believed that the sky, the isles, every single aspect of our world only exists because a Concept died, its corpse becoming the air we breathe or the land we walk in.

# Constellations

Constellations are not immutable, this means that throughout time, as our reality changes and we ourselves change our reality, we also shape the constellations in the sky. Constellations grow, shrink, change shapes and even consume or share stars with other constellations. As new constellations are born, old constellations adapt the new reality. It is, however, unknown is a Constellation can be fully erased, to give you a metaphor, ideas are quite like seed, once they burrow themselves into the mind they are quite difficult to remove and the more you nourish the idea, the more it grows.

The growth and decay of Constellations are not predictable processes, no one person could change the meaning of constellations unless they themselves could or have become one. It’s also hotly debated if Constellations themselves are sentient as they have transcended far beyond what current sentience can fathom.

So, if you are a person with strong convictions or passions then look to the stars, find your guiding lights and one day the stars shall bless your path.
